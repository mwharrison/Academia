Watched: The Maltese Falcon
Read: Cavell, Preface and Chapters 1-3

- Relationships to movies are temporally dislocated, they might feel alive in the theater, but they are not.

Chapters 2 and 3: Aesthetics of Film (or art in general)
- Material basis of the art form: lots of style, originality in all art.
    - Painting: color on 2D surface
    - Sculpt: physical 3D object
    - Literature: language, sound, ideas?
    - Music: sculpting of sounds waves (not goods, physics explains it this way, but not 'artful')
    - FILM: rapid succession of photos.
      Cavell says a photograph is always OF SOMETHING - crucial to understand.
      You can analyze a photograph like a painting, but a painting (or sculpture) is made by hand - not machine. Underlying difference.
      To analyze a Van Gogh, you have to look at the brush strokes - the depth of the painting is throught out.
      * Photographer: cropped out the rest of the universe. Aims the camera, and decided what not to include, or what angle to or not to capture.

Movie going is a social activity. Movies have always drawn people together.

Movies that we watch in this class will be shaped by the experiences that we have in this class and in this period in our life.
