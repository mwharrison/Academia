Film : Wild Strawberries
Read : Mcgin

Approach to film by way of vision.
Not unlike Cavell.
Examine socio-economic thing over time, like movie (we’ve had many years of them).

Starts in experience of the phenomenon. 
1. Sit in theater (or classroom)
2. Lights go off
3. Eye and/or ears engaged (something Cavell never stopped to notice - even though he was very pedantic)
	*we can imagine experiencing a film without our ears, but not our eyes
	*seeing is a mode of reception, once you see it, you are open to understanding it
	*seeing vs looking - looking at something, directed attention towards -> then ask yourself, what do you see
		-eg, look at art, what do I see?
		-eg, listening to the orchestra, heard what? (rarely do you say “music”, something more specific)
		-when your at the theater, you are LOOKING at the screen
	*when you are looking at something through a transparent medium, 
		-eg, you look through the window/glasses/microscope, not at the window/glasses/microscope (unless something is wrong with it, or it’s dirty…)


What do we look through? (**all of these have analogies to cinema..)
	-Holes
		*Why look into a hole? To see if there is a bottom, or where it is.
	-Water (direct vision through water)
		*Look to see object, or the bottom
	-Windows
		*See what’s on the other side
	-Telescope/Microscope (movies magnify objects for us.. without these)
		*magnified version; see things that can’t be seen

	————These are different————
	**We look into them, but why?**
	-Mirrors (you can’t look into the mirror, only at it)
		*you see the best or the worst of yourself
		*not just yourself, but your whole world reflected back
		*the mirror is a flat surface, and its closer to you than the object in it
	-Fire
	-Sky
		*to see stars? to see cloud animals?
			-pherrifial(SP) vision moves back, and you feel curvature of the earth; you feel the size of the sky
	-Eyes
		*closest you can get, is the surface of your eyes looking at the mirror - you won’t see what other people see when they look in your eyes
		*look into someone else eyes, what do you see? you see their self; you see them themselves. You do this intentionally, to see them; there is no other reason.
			*eyes are the windows to the soul - mcgin take this very seriously 
	-Mind
		*reading, looking into the mind of mcgin
		*again, looking into the mind, you see the person
	

Patches of light and motion - make up the screen you are looking at. [current author]
Fine line between light and motion, more so than paint and canvas.

What is looking into something mean?
	-We look into the screen; it’s a window into another world. We look into the screen(window), AT… patches of color and light, in motion… AND we see the actors, sets, etc.

Through the screen, through the light, through the image, at humphrey bogart, into his eye; and you see rick blains… 
**You are looking INTO the actors eyes, as someone else…

CRUCIAL: For Mcgin, looking at and seeing another is unique to film. (Architecture MIGHT also have this element of “looking through”, so he thinks Architecture and Film are the most similar art forms (odd, not photo/painting/music))
	*Often you are looking through the film, the perspective, the depth of it. You never are watching a film and thinking of it as a flat surface.
